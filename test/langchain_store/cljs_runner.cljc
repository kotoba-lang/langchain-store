  "Run the portable suite under ClojureScript (cljs.main --target node):
    clojure -Sdeps '{:paths [\"src\" \"test\"]}' -M:cljs \\
      -m cljs.main --target node --output-dir target/node-out \\

  CLJS is the primary gate (README), which means two things have to be
  true and neither was:

  **1. A red suite has to fail the process.** Setting
  `(.-exitCode js/process)` from the `:end-run-tests` report does not
  survive `cljs.main -m` — measured 2026-08-15: a suite reporting
  `1 failures` still exited 0, so every caller of the documented command
  read the primary gate as green no matter what the tests said. Throwing
  does propagate (exit 1), so this reports first and then throws. Calling
  `js/process.exit` instead was also measured: it hangs `cljs.main`
  indefinitely rather than exiting.

  **2. A suite that did not run has to be distinguishable from one that
  passed.** `min-tests` is an evidence floor — fewer tests than we know
  exist is a failure, not a pass, whether the cause is a namespace
  missing from `-main` or one that failed to load. Both conditions come
  out through the same throw, so neither can be silently green.

  `-main` names each namespace literally because `run-tests` is a macro
  under CLJS (it is a function on the JVM) — a seq of symbols cannot be
  `apply`d to it, and trying compiles to a runtime TypeError."
