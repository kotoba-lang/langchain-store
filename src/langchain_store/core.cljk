  "Shared machinery for `langchain.db`-backed actor stores — the seam
  ~190 cloud-itonami actors currently hand-roll identically (the exact
  two-liner `enc`/`dec*` codec appears verbatim in 190 store.cljc
  files, ADR-2607141600).

  It centralizes the genuinely-common parts:
    - the EDN-blob codec (`enc`/`dec*`): compound values are stored as
      EDN strings so `langchain.db` doesn't expand them into
      sub-entities — the convention every DatomicStore uses;
    - `identity-schema`: build the `:db.unique/identity` schema map;
    - `read-stream` / `append-blob!`: the seq-keyed EDN-blob event-log
      read/append pattern (event-sourced stores).

  The DOMAIN keeps its own field/pull shaping and its `Store`
  protocol — this lib is the reusable substrate underneath, not a
  framework. Portable `.cljc` (JVM/CLJS/kotoba-WASM); the pure parts
  (`enc`/`dec*`/`identity-schema`) have zero deps, the event helpers
  use `langchain.db` (itself the Datomic-API seam, swappable to a
  kotoba-server pod)."

;; files hand-roll `(ls/dec* (d/q ...))` to read one EDN-blob payload by a
;; unique id attribute.** Only 9 of them give it a name (`blob-lookup`);
;; the rest inline the query, so the duplication does not show up in a
;; name-based grep. That is why this pair belongs here and not in each
;; domain: it is not domain shaping, it is the same two-attribute lookup
;; every keyed blob store performs.

(defn blob-lookup
